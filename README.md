# Data-Engineering-Guided-Capstone-Project

The goal of this project is to build an end-to-end data pipeline to ingest and process daily stock
market data from multiple stock exchanges. The pipeline should maintain the source data in a
structured format, organized by date. It also needs to produce analytical results that support
business analysis.
